# Statistical-Analysis using Python

This repository contains a python notebook focused on applying statistical methods and regression analysis on a iris dataset. The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle .

1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide a summary of a dataset's characteristics, including:

> Mean: The average value, sensitive to outliers.

>Median: The middle value, robust to outliers.

>Mode: The most frequent value, useful for categorical data.

>Standard Deviation (SD): Measures data dispersion around the mean.

>Variance: The average of squared differences from the mean.

>Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.

>Percentiles and Quartiles: Indicate distribution spread;
e.g., the Interquartile Range (IQR) is the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles.

>Skewness: Measures data asymmetry.

Kurtosis: Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.


2. Inferential Statistics
   
Inferential statistics help make predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data. Key methods include:


>Hypothesis Testing: Determines if there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis.

>Confidence Intervals: Provides a range of values likely to contain the population parameter.

>Regression Analysis: Models relationships between dependent and independent variables.

>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Compares means across multiple groups.

>Chi-Square Test: Tests independence between categorical variables.
